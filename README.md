# Movies app [WIP]

Movies app using The Movie DB API. It will be under construction for a few weeks from now. For this app I mean to enhance design patterns and to achieve the implementation of a carousel as well as other common features such as pagination, modal and animated layout. And I finally aim to try RTK query for data fetching.

## Built with

<div align='center' width='100%'>
<img src="/src/assets/images/RN_logo.webp" width="110" alt="React Native logo"/>
<img src="/src/assets/images/TS_logo.png" width="70" alt="Typescript logo"/>
<img src="/src/assets/images/Redux_logo.jpeg" width="110" alt="Redux logo"/>
<img src="/src/assets/images/JS_logo.png" width="70" alt="Javascript logo"/>
</div>
</br>
cause practice makes perfect!
